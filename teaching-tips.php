    <h2 class="text-primary mb-4">👧 Profile of a Typical EduConnect Student</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">
      Most students in our program are enrolled in Zilla Parishad schools in rural Maharashtra. These schools often have 400+ students but only 4-5 teachers. Many students are first-generation learners whose families may not fully understand the value of education. Yet, these children are eager to learn and grow — all they need is someone to believe in them.
